# Introduction

In some organisations, engineers get compensated for going *on-call outside of working hours* or *out of hours* or *ooh* for short.

I have a couple of teams at my current workplace that I look after. Both with at least 4 people on the rota. Similarly, we have an *incident commander* rota. And every month, managers have to fill in a spreadsheet for payroll to account for our OOH (out of hours) on-call so that we all get compensated at the end of the month for on-call. This sounds like a simple thing, and it is. Just that it takes about 5 minutes of reconciliation per team's on-call rota.

And if your team is geographically distributed, then you probably have more than one such sheet to fill as each location might have a different payroll and could even have different on-call rates and maybe they even get compensated an additional amount every time they respond to an actual incident by the hour! Who knows?!

That is a lot of productive minutes lost doing the same thing every month. 1 manager with two teams, could take 10 minutes. So imagine having 24 of them do this monthly! 240 minutes of doing mundane things for the company when that could have been invested in more useful, creative work, like building the next big thing!

That's why I wrote `caloohpay` - a thing that **Calculates OOH Pay**.

## How to get started?

Unfortunately this isn't fully packaged up just yet. Not that I did not want to. It does take time to get there. I got this far by spending about 4 hours a day consistently, everyday for about a week and a half. on this project in the last week, I was supposed to be on annual leave. Look what I have done. Anyway, not boring you with my boring life choices. But wanted to give you some context as to why this isn't fully packaged yet.

This is a basic [Typescript project that runs on node](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/nodejs-with-typescript).

1. Clone this repository locally
2. Create `.env` file with the key-value pair for `API_TOKEN` - refer [section](#how-do-i-get-a-pagerduty-api-user-token)

Your `.env` file should look something like this: (This example is not a real key).

```sh
API_TOKEN=u+IrTEYvqbPOc4dMNLyR
```

3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm link`. You may need admin permissions for this one. `sudo` is your friend if you are on *nix or MacOs. If you are on Windows, please search online for a solution. If you find one, create a PR to this repo.
5. Run `caloohpay help` - if the command doesn't work, you need to restart your terminal - as you just ran `npm link`.

I'll script these steps to make it more usable and probably package it up. But that will take another 20 years. So you might as well follow along.

### Tests with ts-jest

If you like to contribute then you know you that you might want to test your code first. Learn jest and then get going.

Followed instructions on [jest via ts-jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#via-ts-jest).

## PagerDuty API User Token

So in order for `caloohpay` to be able to fetch data from Pagerduty, you need to get either an *API token*, meant for API calls from services, like this one, or an *API User token*, which gives the thing making the API call the same permissions as you have.

### How do I get a Pagerduty API User token?

1. Login to Pagerduty
2. Hover over your profile icon, go to *My Profile*.
3. Then go to *User Settings* where you can see a button that reads, *Create API User Token*. Click it.
4. Remember to store the API Key in something like **1Password** so that you can retrieve it securely for later. 
5. I cannot stress this enough but *please don't commit that API KEY to your git repository.*

## The CLI

Before you even download it, just wanted to share what the CLI looks like. 
```sh
caloohpay [options] <args>

Options:
      --version      Show version number  [boolean]
  -r, --rota-ids     1 scheduleId or multiple scheduleIds separated by comma  [string] [required]
  -t, --timeZoneId   the timezone id of the schedule. Refer https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/1afe25e9c94cb-types#time-zone for details.  [string]
  -s, --since        start of the schedule period (inclusive) in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 format  [string]
  -u, --until        end of the schedule period (inclusive) in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 format  [string]
  -k, --key          API_TOKEN to override environment variable API_TOKEN.
                     Get your API User token from
                     My Profile -> User Settings -> API Access -> Create New API User Token  [string]
      --help         Show help  [boolean]

Examples:
  caloohpay -r "PQRSTUV,PSTUVQR,PTUVSQR"    Calculates on-call payments for the comma separated pagerduty scheduleIds.\nThe default timezone is the local timezone. The default period is the previous month.
  caloohpay -r "PQRSTUV" -s "2021-08-01" -u "2021-09-01"    Calculates on-call payments for the schedules with the given scheduleIds for the month of August 2021.

```

## What works?

The solution currently accepts `rotaIds` and since and until dates in string format - `YYYY-MM-DD` format. It assigns default time strings to the *since* and *until* dates if it isn't provided. The solution works and is tested on Europe/London timezone for schedules that are also on that timezone.

For the app to take in timezone and work with it, you could use Luxon.js and replace all the JS Dates to Luxon's DateTime and initialise the instances in the right timezone. I didn't budget for this work as this was a hackathon/firebreak week project. This is a good future addition though. So the command line feature `--timeZoneId` is a no-op at the moment.

The feature command line option `--key`isn't implemented yet.

For generating an output file, you could run the cli and redirect output to a file.

### What are the default values of the *date and time* strings?

- `since` : first day of the previous month with time starting at `00:00:00` in local time
- `until` : first day of the current month with the time `10:00:00` in local time

The latter is set to the value it is to ensure the calculator includes the evening of the last day of the previous month.

## What is to come?

- ❌ allow api key override from cli option
- ❌ respect different timezoneIds from cli
- ❌ allow output file generation - like a csv
- ❌ allow weekday and weekends to be configurable via file input or CLI option
- ❌ allow weekday rates and weekend rates to be configurable
- ❌ add some colour to console output
- ❌ add file generation for output
- ❌ make installable package
- ❌ host this on our internal developer platform and schedule it to run monthly and create a CSV file of auditable on call payment records and send it to the finance team
