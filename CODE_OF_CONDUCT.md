### Our pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at the issue tracker: https://github.com/lonelydev/caloohpay/issues. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

### Scope
