/**
 * Represents a continuous on-call period with automatic OOH (Out of Hours) calculation.
 * 
 * This class encapsulates the business logic for determining whether on-call shifts
 * qualify as "out of hours" work and categorizing them into weekdays vs. weekends.
 * It uses timezone-aware date handling to ensure accurate calculations across
 * different geographical locations.
 * 
 * @category Core
 * 
 * @remarks
 * ## OOH Qualification Criteria
 * 
 * A shift qualifies as OOH (Out of Hours) if it meets ALL of the following:
 * 1. **Spans Days**: Start and end are on different calendar days
 * 2. **After Work Hours**: Extends past 17:30 (end of work day)
 * 3. **Minimum Duration**: Lasts at least 6 hours
 * 
 * ## Day Classification
 * 
 * - **Weekdays** (Mon-Thu): Compensated at £50 per OOH day
 * - **Weekends** (Fri-Sun): Compensated at £75 per OOH day
 * 
 * Note: Friday is considered a weekend day for compensation purposes.
 * 
 * ## Timezone Handling
 * 
 * All date calculations respect the provided timezone to ensure accurate
 * determination of "end of work day" and day boundaries. This is critical
 * for distributed teams across multiple timezones.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create a period for Thursday 5pm to Monday 9am (UK time)
 * const period = new OnCallPeriod(
 *   new Date('2024-08-01T17:30:00+01:00'),
 *   new Date('2024-08-05T09:00:00+01:00'),
 *   'Europe/London'
 * );
 * 
 * console.log(period.numberOfOohWeekDays);    // 1 (Thursday)
 * console.log(period.numberOfOohWeekends);    // 3 (Friday, Saturday, Sunday)
 * // Monday is excluded as shift ends at 09:00 (before 17:30)
 * ```
