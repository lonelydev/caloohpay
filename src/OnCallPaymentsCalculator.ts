/**
 * Calculates on-call compensation for users based on their OOH (Out of Hours) shifts.
 * 
 * This class implements the business logic for computing monetary compensation
 * for on-call duty. It applies fixed rates for weekday and weekend OOH shifts
 * and provides methods for both simple payment calculations and detailed
 * auditable records.
 * 
 * @category Core
 * 
 * @remarks
 * ## Compensation Rates
 * 
 * - **Weekdays** (Monday-Thursday): £50 per OOH day
 * - **Weekends** (Friday-Sunday): £75 per OOH day
 * 
 * These rates are static and can be accessed via:
 * - {@link OnCallPaymentsCalculator.WeekDayRate}
 * - {@link OnCallPaymentsCalculator.WeekEndRate}
 * 
 * ## Calculation Formula
 * 
 * ```
 * Total Compensation = (Weekday OOH Days × £50) + (Weekend OOH Days × £75)
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Validation
 * 
 * All calculation methods validate input to ensure:
 * - User object is defined
 * - User has on-call periods assigned
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const calculator = new OnCallPaymentsCalculator();
 * 
 * // Simple payment calculation
 * const amount = calculator.calculateOnCallPayment(user);
 * console.log(`Total compensation: £${amount}`);
 * 
 * // Batch calculation for multiple users
 * const payments = calculator.calculateOnCallPayments([user1, user2, user3]);
 * console.log(payments); // { 'user-id-1': 275, 'user-id-2': 150, ... }
 * 
 * // Detailed auditable records
 * const records = calculator.getAuditableOnCallPaymentRecords([user1, user2]);
 * // Includes full user details and breakdown
 * ```
